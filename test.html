<p>As we’re about to enter into the new year of 2024, it seems many rising artists and creatives are aspiring to pair the year ahead with a new mindset of how they can grow their business. While some are taking steps in the right direction, others already have a way carved out for themselves and just need the clarity to run it down</p><p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, anybody amongst the DMV music scene that has paid any attention has been able to see that the path <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nastb_/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Nast B</em></strong></a> has paved musically is a bright one. So much so that creating the business idea of throwing his own shows for himself alongside fellow artist-friends in the industry, as well as new up and coming talent would be a no-brainer</p><p>Which made tonight, November 24th, one of the most electrifying nights Montgomery County has ever been able to witness in a very long time. No, not because it’s Black Friday and those Thanksgiving leftovers are still fresh, but because the realest one out of the county was able to put together his first self-funded show with his team. Bringing out the likes of DMV royalty <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bigflock187/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Big Flock</em></strong></a>, and Rockville’s own <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilxelly/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Lil Xelly</em></strong></a>, anticipation grew rapidly for what Nast and his crew had up their sleeves</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/template-photo--38-.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2500" srcset="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/template-photo--38-.png 600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/template-photo--38-.png 1000w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/template-photo--38-.png 1600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/template-photo--38-.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Nast and his manager <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bossbeez_/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Boss Beez</em></strong></a> have made tremendous strides as an artist and manager pairing in a fast six-year run, and one of the biggest things that have gotten them so far is their want for building a strong foundation in the creative community. Giving back and interacting with your section is something that isn’t mandatory for artists, however, it makes the successful ones stand few and far between</p><p>With the start of <a href="https://doublemstudios.com/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer">Double M Studios</a> and numerous other resources, both Nast and Beez have set a precedent that they are catered to helping the ecosystem of DMV art. So, before even walking into <a href="https://twinvalleyd.com/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer">Twin Valley Distillery</a> of Rockville Maryland, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rdi-nights-ft-big-flock-and-lil-xelly-registration-753389146217?aff=odcleoeventsincollection&ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer">RDI Nights 1</a> already resonated with the large group of people standing in line waiting to be checked into the venue</p><p>Because this was an event for the community, the opportunity for Nast and the guys to create a pleasant experience for attendees was important. Several independent businesses who were connected to Nast and Double M provided a grand connection with their business before the show even started</p><p>The merch table ranged from three different aspects of streetwear in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/live.dbm/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Live.DBM</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bluefaceaddicts/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>B.F.A</em></strong></a><strong><em> (Blue Face Addicts)</em></strong>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sleepwenworldwide/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>SleepWen Worldwide</em></strong></a>, while the food table right outside of the venue captured a creative spin on Caribbean and African cuisines from <a href="https://little-island-kitchen.square.site/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer">Little Island Kitchen</a> and Siya. Not forgetting to mention, Ant from the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thespeakyourtruthpod/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Speak Your Truth Podcast</em></strong></a> was conducting full interviews for each and every artist to speak on what their experience was like on stage. These treats were just an introduction to how unique an encounter with RDI Nights is even if you just came for a music show</p><p>As people packed the crowd by 8:45pm, the festivities began with opening artists (new and experienced) who took this occasion to perform in front of a hefty audience full of unfamiliar faces. Knowing that a lot of people were showing up with the mindset of only seeing three Maryland juggernauts perform, each of the eight total opening acts seized the moment and took the stage by the headlock</p>

        <p>Kicking off with the talented newcomers in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chuckyxwiggity/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Chuck3x</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/flatoutbrian/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Flat Out Brian</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/swiftzooted/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>SwiftZooted</em></strong></a>, the three of these guys started the show off right with the proper bang that it needed. The crowd opened up immediately forging bright energy towards the next performers and everyone who was in attendance. Which next brought along the few experienced artists who have been pursuing their artistry for some time and were known to provide great performances in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/feedbravo/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>FeedBravo</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/24pearlz/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Pearlz</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/wwjaco/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Jaco</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and </em></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kindrew_/?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Kindrew</em></strong></a></p><p>Jaco, who like Nast is also an artist and studio owner himself, suffered from a knee injury yet took the stage with a brace to show his dedication to putting on a great show. His performance was such an indulging moment as his passion poured into every record he performed, highlighting just how indulging his music is to a listener; it only makes you want more. Which is what it felt like as the openers closed and we headed to a brief break, the excitement amongst the room grew where it became undeniable. We wanted to see more, we wanted to see what can turn out next after seeing such a masterclass of performances from all eight openers; and sure enough, the show was just getting started</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_4693.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1136" srcset="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/IMG_4693.jpg 600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/IMG_4693.jpg 1000w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/IMG_4693.jpg 1600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_4693.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>With Lil Xelly beginning the headlining segment of the show, he quickly initiates how excited he was to be performing in front of his home crowd again. Xelly being a Rockville representative, it was only a must that he would carry on a high level of excitement throughout the night, and he did just that. Xelly would spend much of the night vibing to the sound of his own drum from one side to the other and creating the very effortless vibe that he possesses in all of his extensive catalog. A twelve-minute performance is actually not enough for how much crank Xelly actually has</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/yEwE-b266d9bv5d1TH0DTZ1FiGsKw_Y3nY56GVkN2uQ.webp" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="956" height="1122" srcset="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/yEwE-b266d9bv5d1TH0DTZ1FiGsKw_Y3nY56GVkN2uQ.webp 600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/yEwE-b266d9bv5d1TH0DTZ1FiGsKw_Y3nY56GVkN2uQ.webp 956w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Which is also the same sentiment when it comes to Big Flock, who’s catalog dates back to early 2013 when he was making a name as a new artist alongside <strong><em>Thraxxx</em></strong>. With Flock being one of the forefathers for this current explosive DMV Rap scene today, his introduction to the stage needed no extras. Which you can also say was a part of the reason why the audience was so hesitant as Flock opens the performance up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyQHNwRlulc&ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Doodle Bob</em></strong></a>. The admiration for someone that we’ve been listening to for a mere ten years is so high that it almost felt unreal to watch him rap one of his most recent hits to you; and Flock noticed</p><blockquote><strong><em>“Listen man, I’m about to get in the damn crowd cause y’all not lit enough for me”</em></strong> </blockquote><p>He jokingly states, as he then makes his way over the front speakers and pursues to perform two of his most noticeable records, <strong><em>“</em></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGocJj-53M4&ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Eye for An Eye</em></strong></a><strong><em>” &amp; “</em></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O0HZSXXyZs&ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Linebacker</em></strong></a><strong><em>”</em></strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_2408.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="750" height="746" srcset="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/IMG_2408.jpg 600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/IMG_2408.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>At this point you can feel the floor start to rumble like an earthquake as each person in the room proceeds to mosh with Flock in the middle of his set. The rush that exuded in Flock’s face seeing so many unfamiliar people rejoice with him for 5 minutes straight was beyond evident, and seemingly made all the possible doubts of what type of night RDI Nights was going to all go away in Nast’s view. Which now made the opportunity for them to perform their recent hit, <strong><em>“</em></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06utlxbnufw&ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Full of Smoke</em></strong></a><strong><em>”, </em></strong>feel so good</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06utlxbnufw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="NAST B - FULL OF SMOKE  FEAT. BIG FLOCK (Official Music Video) | Dir. By 95 Productions Music Video"></iframe></figure><p>Nast takes the stage and trades bar for bar with Flock throughout the song while embracing each other at the very end signifying the kind gesture it was for Nast to invite Flock as a headliner. Nast goes off into his set immediately stamping his stage presence amongst the crowd and grabbing everyone’s attention with his very first song, <strong><em>“Still”</em></strong>, being one of the attention-grabbing tracks off the recent EP release, <strong><em>“</em></strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4HuGsUtVzwIpne5vfJpkK2?autoplay=true&ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>It’ll All Make Sense</em></strong></a><strong><em>”</em></strong>. The timeless <strong><em>Jay-Z</em></strong>, “<strong><em>Can I Live</em></strong>” sample is a cheat code when it’s paired with Nast’s undeniable swagger and lyrical ability. Which is also similar to the 2022 release of Nast and Xelly’s hit record, <strong><em>“</em></strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/26tXbz6bpHa89cmskznWVT?ref=blog.realdealindividual.com" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>Stick &amp; Mags</em></strong></a><strong><em>”</em></strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JL7s-ortSc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="NAST B  X  XELLY - &quot; Sticks &amp; Mags&quot; (Official Video) | Directed by 95 Productions"></iframe></figure><p>Another track with immediate impact highlighting the contagious energy both Nast and Xelly possess when they hop on tracks together. The song is so vibey that there was almost no need for Nast or Xelly to even rap the words as they were performing; you just had to move your body! And that’s what most of Nast’s setlist felt like throughout the rest of the night, fifteen minutes straight of what seemed like an entire room of supporters finishing his raps for him. In a moment, it seemed as if everyone was pleased with the money that was spent to come see a great show, and that they were showing gratitude for how much they were in tune with the hometown hero for betting on himself and his team when putting it together</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/Copy-of-template-photo.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/Copy-of-template-photo.png 600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/Copy-of-template-photo.png 1000w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/Copy-of-template-photo.png 1600w, https://blog.realdealindividual.com/content/images/2024/03/Copy-of-template-photo.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">You couldn’t do anything but salute</blockquote>
