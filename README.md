# Real Deal Individual

This is my project for creating the website for www.realdealindividual.com

I decided to take this project on to put all of my skills to the test and to provide Nast B with a functional and highly-customizable website. Also, because Nast B & RDI are "startups" in my eyes, it wasn't worth paying a monthly fee for website hosting when this can be hosted on my github for a nominal cost relative to Webflow, Squarespace, Typedream, etc.
